Minutes 17/7/24
Confirmed some parts
How do we send stuff back to the boards? Where do we send it?
LoraWAN two way comms
Using nrf chip as gateway - send lte to that
three gateway modes - C-whenever, A-small window, B-bigger window, something like that
how do we connect to multiple connected to same gateway? just something in packet?
Aloha-like mac
Conor having software problems
i2c not working - probably hardware issue
think SPI is working - think it's working but Arduino receiving might not?
Logan also tried to get SPI working - single direction worked, don't like being slave devices
Can use uart instead of SPI
Better to use uart or usart? depends on data speed, probably doesn't matter we'll just use uart
STMcubed doesn't like pin stacking, need to write custom driver for uart
Chloe got webapi
Json over lorawan may not work - use short string, power issues
Lora hat ordered
Cellular and Lora combined.
Will just use battery pack for now, power board coming
Devkit doesn't have lora
Have a gateway/access point, want own router for that
Get a box to put everything in
Logan able to import boards into blender so can visualize
Need to get LTE to azure - won't be ip over LTE
Real world test - use photoresistor so can wave hand over it
Project inspection Thursday 10:30-12:00, Lui in lecture, need to change
Think about what we can show for demo
Order, Logan - Josh - Josh - Conor - Chloe
Got about 8 weeks to finish everything - need to plan for that
Update Gantt chart
Get back on track
What's plan B if this is completely unrealistic?
real world - what's stopping it from working? what can you do to make it happen?
throw money at the problem
university time-rich cost-poor, companies time-poor cost-rich
